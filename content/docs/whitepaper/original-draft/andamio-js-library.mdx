# AndamioJS Library

The AndamioJS Library provides off-chain code for interacting with the [Andamio Smart Contracts](Andamio%20Smart%20Contracts%20e73ec0ecd504477aaf18f53ff71d510b.md) in an Andamio Instance. It allows anyone with an Andamio Instance to create a unique front-end. There can be many different User Interfaces for interacting with the Andamio Network.

AndamioJS provides: 1. A set of functions for using Andamio data 2. A set of transaction functions for interacting with Andamio, that work with [CIP-30 enabled](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) Cardano browser-based wallets like [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/), [Eternl](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome), or [Typhon](https://typhonwallet.io/).

AndamioJS is only the first implementation of Andamio off-chain code. In the future, there will be additional implementations, along with specialized indexers that make it more efficient to interact with the network.

We are building bridges to [Plutus PBL](https://plutuspbl.io/), where the ongoing work of building Andamio is featured in course projects, and hosting community meetings to debate how to best balance utility and decentralization while building off-chain systems. Just like Andamio is built to solve interconnected problems, it is built with interconnected tooling. As development continues, Andamio is built to evolve along with the Cardano ecosystem.

To start, AndamioJS provides two libraries: 1. The AndamioJS Library: For use in any Javascript/Typescript project 2. The AndamioJS Starter Template: A fully-functional front end that works with any Andamio Instance. Built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

These libraries are designed specifically to work with the [Andamio Smart Contracts](Andamio%20Smart%20Contracts%20e73ec0ecd504477aaf18f53ff71d510b.md), which are the building blocks of the Andamio Protocol.

## Andamio JS Package

AndamioJS is currently in development and will be released in Q4 of 2023. When it is published, Javascript/Typescript developers will be able to add it to any project, and start building with Andamio:

```bash
npm install andamio # or,yarn add andamio
```

Along with the library, full documentation of AndamioJS will be published in Q4 of 2023. The [Andamio Development Roadmap](Development%20Roadmap%202c170197d1264326a6cd866f5399518b.md) includes a full list of upcoming milestones.

## AndamioJS Starter Template

A starter template built with the [React](https://react.dev/) framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is also provided. Once again, this is only the first implementation of an Andamio front-end. Additional templates can be built with other React frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), or without using React at all: AndamioJS works with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

As the network of Andamio instances grows, so will the tooling that works with it. As Gimbalabs PBL Courses continue to evolve, we’ll always have a backlog of projects to take on: building new templates in additional frameworks, building APIs, and building tools. This is an example of how Andamio supports organic network growth. Along the way we’ll document the process and create additional case studies to be used by other organizations as they onboard to the Andamio network.
