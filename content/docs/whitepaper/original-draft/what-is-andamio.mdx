# What is Andamio

Andamio is a platform for organizational development built on Cardano. It provides a modular toolkit for learning management, contributor onboarding, emergent credentials, and treasury governance. Andamio uniquely blends Cardano smart contracts and design patterns for decentralized applications with project-based learning methodologies and principles of evolutionary organizations.

By combining a technical toolkit with principles of Project-Based Learning, Andamio empowers people and organizations to address big, complex, interconnected problems. As a result, Andamio enables new modes of collaboration across a network of people and organizations. In the rest of this paper, we will take a detailed look at the Andamio Toolkit and accompanying methodologies.

The mission of Andamio is to support people to learn, organize, and share information enough to solve big problems. Andamio is built for anyone who wants to learn enough to contribute to breakthrough projects, and it is built for organizations seeking new ways to collaborate by sharing resources and decentralizing decision-making power.

## Introducing Andamio

In this section, we will investigate the Andamio Toolkit:

Along the way, we will explore the Roles of different participants on the Andamio Platform, the ways that people and organizations can interact, and our methodology for building a multi-headed Layer 2 protocol on Cardano.
