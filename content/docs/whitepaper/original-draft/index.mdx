# Updated Outline

## I. Introduction: Where People Come Together to Collaborate on Work That Matters
**The Problem-Solving Imperative** - Why our current global "operating system" limits collaborative capacity at scale
**Coming Attractions** - Preview of how protocol-native infrastructure transforms treasury administration, organizational onboarding, and project coordination

## II. Three Interconnected Problems
- **The Education Problem**: Learning systems disconnected from meaningful contribution  
- **The Organization Problem**: Scaling challenges that orient away from problem-solving
- **The Oracle Problem**: Information overload preventing trusted collaboration
- Why these problems require a protocol-level solution

## III. The Andamio Protocol
- **Core Architecture**: One global state, many local states
- How protocol-first design addresses all three problems simultaneously
- Moving beyond platform limitations to true collaborative infrastructure

## IV. Protocol Components and Mechanisms
- Access tokens and governance systems
- Validation infrastructure and SSOI (Self-Sovereign Organizational Identity)
- Portable credentials and flexible prerequisites

## V. Use Cases: Protocol-Enabled Problem Solving
- **Treasury Administration**: DAOs and organizations managing resources with transparency
- **Contributor Onboarding**: Organizations seamlessly integrating talent with portable reputations
- **Project Networks**: Teams forming around breakthrough work with validated capabilities
- **Custom Collaboration Contexts**: Building new local states for emerging needs

## VI. Technical Architecture
- Protocol specifications and formal documentation
- Integration pathways for existing systems
- Development frameworks for extensibility

## VII. Tokenomics and Governance (In Development)
- Economic models supporting sustainable collaboration
- Decentralized governance enabling protocol evolution

## VIII. Ongoing Development
- Open source development and community engagement
- Roadmap for expanding global problem-solving capacity
